Plot received power with RIS over a grid
========================================

This example shows how one can plot the received power map, i.e.,
the power received at each (x, y) coordinate as the sum of the power from
each transmitter.

At the center of the scene, a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)
is placed, using the :class:`RIS<differt2d.geometry.RIS>` class. The
model is very simple, as it amounts to force the reflection angle
to be fixed to some angle ``phi``.

# First, we need to import the necessary modules.

# Scene
# -----
#
# We construct a very simple scene, and add some RIS wall that
# should reflect any incident ray with a reflection angle of 45Â°.

# Below, we setup the plot. Note that we only generate first-order
# paths, not the line-of-sight, to better illustrate the effect of the RIS.
