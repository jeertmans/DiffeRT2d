## Installation

<!-- start install -->

While installing DiffeRT2d and its dependencies on your global Python is fine,
we recommend using a virtual environment
(e.g., [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)) for a local installation.

### Dependencies

<!-- start deps -->

DiffeRT2d uses [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax)
for automatic differentation,
which in turn may use (or not) CUDA for GPU acceleration.

If needed, please refer to
[JAX's installation guidelines](https://github.com/google/jax#installation)
for more details.

<!-- end deps -->

### Pip Install

The recommended way to install the latest release is to use pip:

```bash
pip install differt2d
```

### Install From Repository

An alternative way to install DiffeRT2d is to clone the git repository,
and install from there:

[contributing guide](https://eertmans.be/DiffeRT2d/contributing/workflow.html)
to know how.
